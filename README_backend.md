### Description

Assume your mobile team wants to create an application that will list characters from Star Wars to users.  
Your job as a BE developer is to provide the team with the API endpoints they need.  
You may choose any technology you want for storing the data.  

### Requirements

- Retrieve a list of all star wars characters (you can use the [swapi](https://swapi.dev/) to retrieve those data):
  - Each character should have the following attributes: 
    - name
    - height
    - mass
    - hair_color
    - skin_color
    - eye_color
    - birth_year
    - gender
    - image
    - home_world_name
  - The application should be able to search characters based on their name or their home_world_name and order them based on their birth_year, name, mass or height
  - The image field is optional, you may use a default image.
- Admin users of the application should be able to:
  - **View** the list of the star wars characters.
  - Search characters by their name or home_world_name, and order them by their birth_year, name, mass or height
  - Upload an image for the character of their choice.
- **BONUS**:
  - Users of the application should be able to select and view their favorite characters.
  - Admin users can see a user's favorite characters when browsing a user.

Also, please try to include any relevant unit test and code comments with your work.

### Delivery

Delivery instruction can be found [here](README.md).

It would be good if the code is accompanied by a small report / documentation of the work you have done.

May the force be with you!
